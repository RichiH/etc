The expected use of this repository is:

- clone it to ~/etc/
- symlink every ~/etc/dot/foo to ~/.foo except ~/.config
- symlink every ~/etc/dot/config/foo to ~/.config/foo

I don't have a script to generate/refresh these symlink farms yet, sorry!

This set of configuration files has primitive support for machine-specific
customization. Drop a file in ~/.config/etc.machine/`hostname`.rc and it'll get
sourced from bashrc.

Additional niceties include:

* generate-gitconfig-local.sh, which reads dot/gitconfig and appends a
  stanza for user.email, and outputs to dot/gitconfig.local. The
  intent is that you symlink ~/etc/dot/gitconfig.local to
  ~/.gitconfig. [FIXME: perhaps dot/gitconfig should just be here in
  etc/gitconfig?]

* strip_empty_stanzas.py, which filters the output of "mr status" to remove
  "on branch master / nothing to commit" blocks.
