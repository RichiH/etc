The expected use of this repository is:

- clone it to ~/etc/
- symlink every ~/etc/dot/foo to ~/.foo except ~/.config
- symlink every ~/etc/dot/config/foo to ~/.config/foo

Included in this repo is a script to do this. To run:

cd ~; ~/etc/bin/link-to-dotfiles ~/etc/dot

- To clone all the submodules (bin/contrib, and dot/emacs.d/elhome/site-lisp/upstream), do: git submodule init; git submodule update

- git submodule init
- git submodule update

This set of configuration files has primitive support for machine-specific
customization. Drop a file in ~/.config/etc.machine/`hostname`.rc and it'll get
sourced from bashrc.

Additional niceties include:

* strip_empty_stanzas.py, which filters the output of "mr status" to remove
  "on branch master / nothing to commit" blocks.
